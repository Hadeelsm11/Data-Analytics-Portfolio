## About Me!
Hello! My name is Hadeel and I am an information science student with a concentration in data science and analytics. I attend the University of South Florida in Tampa, Florida. This repository serves to showcase my skills and as a platform to share my projects, and a way to track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science-related topics. My interest in data analysis has grown since high school and I am always excited to work on a new project. I have experience as a data analyst intern at the University of South Florida.
