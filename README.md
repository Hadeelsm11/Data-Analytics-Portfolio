# Data-Analytics-Portfolio
## About Me!
Hello! My name is Hadeel and I am an information science student with a concentration in data science and analytics. I attend the University of South Florida in Tampa, Florida. This repository serves to showcase my skills and as a platform to share my projects, and a way to track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science-related topics. My interest in data analysis has grown since high school and I am always excited to work on a new project. I have experience as a data analyst intern at the University of South Florida.

### Factors That Lead to Credit Approval
**Machine Learning:** [Credit Risk Analysis](https://github.com/Hadeelsm11/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/blob/main/Credit%20Risk%20Analysis/cred_risk_updated.ipynb) 

**Exploratory Data Analysis:** [Credit Risk EDA](https://github.com/Hadeelsm11/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/blob/main/Credit%20Risk%20Analysis/cred_risk_EDA.ipynb)

**Goal:** Why do banks approve credit for some individuals and not others? What factors lead to a better chance for an approval? We want to see which variables effect a bank to approve a loan or credit line. The dataset includes features such as gender, age, whether there was a prior default, and if they are employed. 

**Skills:** data visualization, machine learning, logistic regression, one-hot encoding, decison trees, grid search

**Technology/Libraries:** Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

**Results:** Using the Python language, we can conclude that if an individual fails to fulfill their obligations to repay a previous debt, then they will unlikely be approved for another loan or a credit application. This is the biggest factor for an approval, other variables include credit score and if they are employed. Using sklearn we can also see that for the best accuracy score, the decison tree should be at a depth of two. 

### Brick by Brick: A Data-Driven Exploration of LEGO Set Trends and Insights
**Exploratory Data Analysis:**[https://github.com/Hadeelsm11/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/blob/main/Legos/LEGOS.R]

**Data Visualization:**[https://github.com/Hadeelsm11/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/blob/main/Legos/Legos_Average_Colors.pdf]

**Goal:** In this analytical journey, we aim to delve into the evolution of LEGO sets, seeking to understand their changing complexity and design principles over the years. We'll first explore whether LEGO sets have grown more intricate by assessing metrics like piece count and design diversity. Our focus will then shift to the color dynamics, investigating the average color palette of the early sets and pinpointing the three rarest hues throughout LEGO's history. Ultimately, we aspire to identify the crown jewel of LEGO design: the most complex set ever produced. Through these insights, we hope to provide a succinct overview of LEGO's transformative journey, catering to collectors, enthusiasts, and the brand itself.

**Skills:** data visualization, data collection, data manipulation, data cleaning

**Technology/Packages:** ggplot2, readr, dplyr

**Results:** Through out this analysis, our stakeholder has asked about colors, set size, and the most complex lego set. We can conclude that from 1950 to 2020, the size of a lego set has increased over the years, doubling over the years. The top three rarest colors include: Trans Light Royal Blue, Medium Violet, and Very Light Gray. Lastly, the most complex lego set with the most amount of pieces is the "Taj Mahal Sculptures" released in 2008.
