## About Me!
Hello! My name is Hadeel and I am an information science student with a concentration in data science and analytics. I attend the University of South Florida in Tampa, Florida. This repository serves to showcase my skills and as a platform to share my projects, and a way to track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science-related topics. My interest in data analysis has grown since high school and I am always excited to work on a new project. I have experience as a data analyst intern at the University of South Florida.

### Factors That Lead to Credit Approval
**Machine Learning:** [Credit Risk Analysis](https://github.com/Hadeelsm11/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/blob/main/Credit%20Risk%20Analysis/cred_risk_updated.ipynb) 

**Exploratory Data Analysis:** [Credit Risk EDA](https://github.com/Hadeelsm11/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/blob/main/Credit%20Risk%20Analysis/cred_risk_EDA.ipynb)

**Goal:** Why do banks approve credit for some individuals and not others? What factors lead to a better chance for an approval? We want to see which variables effect a bank to approve a loan or credit line. The dataset includes features such as gender, age, whether there was a prior default, and if they are employed. 

**Skills:** data visualization, machine learning, logistic regression, one-hot encoding, decison trees, grid search

**Technology/Libraries:** Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

**Results:** Using the Python language, we can conclude that if an individual fails to fulfill their obligations to repay a previous debt, then they will unlikely be approved for another loan or a credit application. This is the biggest factor for an approval, other variables include credit score and if they are employed. Using sklearn we can also see that for the best accuracy score, the decison tree should be at a depth of two.
